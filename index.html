            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Marco, an Honours Computer Science with a minor in Statistics student at McGill University with a
                strong interest in systems, machine learning, and building software. I originally decided to pursue
                computer science out of passion for applying mathematical theory to real-world problems through code,
                and
                I've recently become equally captivated by systems design and lower-level programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work is driven by curiosity and experimentation. I've built projects ranging from AI-driven remote
                desktop control systems to transformer-based machine learning models, often focusing on performance,
                interpretability, and practical deployment. A strong foundation in computer science fundamentals helps
                me
                pick up new topics quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                What sets my work apart is a balance between technical depth and execution: I care not just about what
                works, but why it works, and how it can be made efficient, reliable, and usable. I'm always looking to
                learn, iterate, and push ideas from concept to production.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        This
                        project was done in
                        for the McGill CodeJam hackathon, where we were selected as top 3 finalists out of 76 teams by
                        the judges and finished 2nd overall
                        by a participant vote. My contributions focused on engineering a low-latency media pipeline
                        using MediaMTX, FFmpeg and Cloudflare which allowed us to stream any home desktop with minimal
                        delay and a reliable connection to any device in the world through the web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final system combines speech recognition, AI agent processing, and real-time streaming to
                        allow
                        users to interact with
                        their computers remotely from any location by typing or speaking commands or speaking natural
                        language instructions. The command is interpreted by Claude API to translate into keyboard and
                        mouse intructions,
                        and these are executed on the remote desktop while the user sees a live video feed of their
                        screen.
