            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Marco, an Honours Computer Science with a minor in Statistics student at McGill University with a
                strong interest in systems, machine learning, and building software. I originally decided to pursue
                computer science out of passion for applying mathematical theory to real-world problems through code,
                but
                I've recently become equally captivated by systems design and lower-level programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work is driven by curiosity and experimentation. I've built projects ranging from AI-driven remote
                desktop control systems to transformer-based machine learning models, often focusing on performance,
                interpretability, and practical deployment. A strong foundation in computer science fundamentals helps
                me
                pick up new topics quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                What sets my work apart is a balance between technical depth and execution: I care not just about what
                works, but why it works, and how it can be made efficient, reliable, and usable. I'm always looking to
                learn, iterate, and push ideas from concept to production.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        This
                        project was done in
                        for the McGill CodeJam hackathon, where we were selected as top 3 finalists out of 76 teams by
                        the judges and finished 2nd overall
                        by a participant vote. My contributions focused on engineering a low-latency media pipeline
                        using MediaMTX, FFmpeg and Cloudflare which allowed us to stream any home desktop with minimal
                        delay and a reliable connection to any device in the world through the web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final system combines speech recognition, AI agent processing, and real-time streaming to
                        allow
                        users to interact with
                        their computers remotely from any location by typing or speaking commands or speaking natural
                        language instructions. The command is interpreted by Claude API to translate into keyboard and
                        mouse intructions,
                        and these are executed on the remote desktop while the user sees a live video feed of their
                        screen.

                    <h3>Dating Online Text Using Transformer Models</h3>
                    <img class="project-thumb" src="MAISProject.png" alt="Screenshot of demo website done for MAIS" />
                    <p>Fine-tuned a RoBERTa-based transformer to classify online text by time period, achieving 85%
                        accuracy and deploying an
                        interactive demo to present results. Was done in a team of 4 for an extracuricular course, MAIS
                        202: Accelerated Introduction to Machine Learning, ran by the McGill Artificial Intellligence
                        Society. I was one of 30 students selected to be part of the course, which is designed to
                        prepare
                        undergraduate students for roles in AI industry and research.

                    <p>One of my highlight contributions,
                        other then designing the main script used for fine-tuning
                        was, was building a Bash-based data collection and preprocessing workflow that reduced 3.12 TB
                        of compressed raw data into a
                        manageable, task-specific dataset.

                    <h3>An Application of Markov Chains and Graph Theory to Web Page Ranking</h3>
                    <p>
                        Implemented a simplified version of Google's PageRank algorithm by modelling web navigation
                        using graph theory and
                        Markov chains. Built a Python web crawler using Beautiful Soup to collect and analyze real-world
                        data. Developed custom
                        matrix and graph classes from scratch (no external numerical libraries) to compute page
                        rankings. Interpreted academic
                        research and translated theoretical models into working code, documented in technical report.
